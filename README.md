# 🧠 Classification with Logistic Regression

This project is part of an AI & ML internship task that focuses on building a **binary classifier** using **Logistic Regression**. The dataset used is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**, which classifies tumors as malignant or benign.

## 📌 Objective
To learn and implement binary classification using logistic regression and evaluate the model using various performance metrics.
